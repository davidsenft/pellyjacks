## Backstory ##

Says Dan:

> Yum, brunch!

Says Dave:

> Jelly packs!

## How to play the game ##

1.	Go to brunch with a friend, somewhere where they give you
	those little packs of jelly.
2.	Arrange the jelly packs in a <b>m</b>x<b>n</b> grid, 
	because why not.
3.	Any time there is only a single jelly pack in any space on 
	the grid, we'll refer to that piece as a *"pelly jack"*, or 
	simply a "jack" (because brunch is early, and oftentimes 
	disorienting). Right now the grid contains only jacks.
3.	The row of the grid closest to player one is player 
	one's *"rack"*; the same goes for player two.
4.	A move may consist of:
	- <b>"Stacking a jack"</b> - Take any single jack and stack 
	it on top of an adjacent jack (or onto an existing stack),
	leaving behind an empty space in the grid.
	- <b>"Passing a stack"</b> - Slide any stack onto an 
	adjacent empty space in the grid.
	- <b>"Racking a stack"</b> - Remove a stack from your own 
	rack, and earn one point from each pack in that stack.
5.	YOU MAY NOT:
	- Stack a stack
	- Rack a jack
	- Pass a jack
6.	Players alternate until no moves remain, at which point the 
	player who has racked the most packs wins the game.
7.	By now your meal has arrived. Have a snack.

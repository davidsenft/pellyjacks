# Pellyjacks

A spreadable game by David Senft and Daniel Wollin

### Backstory ###

Says Dan:

> Yum, brunch!

Says Dave:

> Jelly packs!

### Rules of the game ###

*	Start with an *m*x*n* board, with 1 jelly pack in each position.
	Because brunch is early, and at times disorienting, we'll refer to
	these pieces as *pellyjacks* or just *jacks*.

## Backstory ##

Says Dan:

> Yum, brunch!

Says Dave:

> Jelly packs!

## How to play the game ##

1.	Go to brunch with a friend, somewhere with a plentiful 
	supply of those little packs of jelly.
2.	Arrange the jelly packs in a grid, because why not.
3.	When a space on the grid contains only one jelly pack, that
	pack is called a *"pelly jack"* (or simply a *"jack"*). A 
	tower of packs, on the other hand, is called a *"stack"*. 
	Right now the grid contains only jacks.
4.	The row of the grid closest to player one is player 
	one's *"rack"*; the same goes for player two.
5.	A move may consist of:
	- <b>"Stacking a jack"</b> - Take any single jack and stack 
	it on top of an adjacent jack or stack, leaving behind an 
	empty space in the grid.
	- <b>"Passing a stack"</b> - Slide any stack onto an 
	adjacent empty space in the grid.
	- <b>"Racking a stack"</b> - Remove a stack from your own 
	rack, and earn one point from each pack in that stack.
6.	YOU MAY NOT:
	- Stack a stack
	- Rack a jack
	- Pass a jack
7.	Players alternate until no moves remain, at which point the 
	player who has racked the most packs wins the game.
8.	If you can't tell who is winning, or what's going on, don't
	be discouraged. Brunch is early, and oftentimes disorienting.
9.	Your meal has arrived! Have a snack.
